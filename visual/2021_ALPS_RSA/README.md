# General

These images were initially designed for the BCS RSA studies I conducted at the ALPS Lab during Fall 2021-Summer 2022.

The original images were taken from freepik.com and unsplash.com. The majority of the images are photographs. Some images are CGI generated and meant to look realistic (e.g. the necklace, ruler, shovel, bonbon, fork, vase, etc.).

Images were edited in photoshop whereby:
1. their background was removed
2. they were each given four colors

This repo contains the original photoshop files (a single file per object), all the output images, and smaller versions of the images actually used in the studies.


# Color schemes
Each of the objects was created in one of two color schemes (CS):
**CS1** : {red, blue, yellow, white}
**CS2** : {purple, green, orange, black}

Half the objects were feminine and half masculine in BCS (Serbian dialect specifically).

The following objects were created:  

**CS1 Feminine**: dress, billiardball, binder, book, bracelet, bucket, candle, chair, guitar, mug, napkin, ornament, shoe, stapler, notebook, yarn, door, mask, shirt, pencil, iron, armchair, magnifyingglass, lamp, fence, crown

**CS1 Masculine**: wallet, balloon, belt, bike, butterfly, cap, coathanger, comb, cushion, flower, frame, phone, rug, scarf, ring, clock, fryingpan, present, bed, calculator, mouse (of a computer), ruler, key, table, switch, sword

**CS2 Feminine**: bench, die, spoon, fork, ribbon, camera, glove, shovel, dresser, slipper, vase, ladle, purse, box, sock, tie, necklace, cake, seashell, fish, bonbon (candy), basket, duck, bowl, whistle, boot

**CS2 Masculine**: plate, radio, truck, tv, calendar, piano, luggage, airplane, helicopter, drum, umbrella, knife, robot, microscope, shield, bandaid, binoculars, hammer, tent, lock, lipstick, razor, remotecontrol, rope, sponge, screwdriver,

# Norming
These stimuli were normed for name-ability and color identifiability. You can find these norming studies in the bwaldon/crosssling-reference repo.

Words that I thought of (that are Masculine/Feminine in BCS) and that I did not include: keyboard, bušilica, klješta, lepeza, arrow, testera, axe, fountain, (painting) brush, boot, curtain, scale, faucet, wheel, kite, ventilator (electric fan), magnet, telescope, vacuum, lawnmower.
